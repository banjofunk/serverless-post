# serverless-post

This is an example of a monorepo with the following stack:
- yarn workspaces
- AWS Cognito with Social Sign-In (amplify)
- AWS Appsync (amplify)
- AWS Lambda (serverless-cli)
- AWS Lambda Layers (serverless-cli)
- SolidJS

I stopped myself from going too far down the rabbit hole with GraphQL Subscriptions for this, but I typically do work with real time data.
